                I am highly motivated for continued education. I started out on a journey to go to medical school but as my bachelors continued I realized that I have a passion for chemical lab work. I completed an organic synthesis capstone in my senior year and found that lab work would be something I want to do in the future. My drive to learn didn't stop with chemical work though. I see how computers are being integrated in almost every aspect of our world so I thought a background in computer science could help drive progress forward. I am currently enrolled in a computer coding bootcamp through the University of Washington. It will be completed in February of 2023. After, I plan to pursue a career in the field. I also have a passion for learning languages and I am currently self teaching Norwegian. I have previously studied Spanish, French and German.

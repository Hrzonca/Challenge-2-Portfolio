# Challenge-2-Portfolio
Description
The motivation for this project was to create a portfolio to show off to future employers. We wanted to show off our advance css skills we learned the previous week. skills that include flex, effects on images and text as well as our ablity to build a site from scratch. 
I tried to incorperate everything that we learned but im sure I messed up somewhere. The github page is showing up different from my HTML.
